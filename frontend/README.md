# Frontend (Vite + React)

This is a minimal Vite + React frontend that demonstrates fetching products and adding items to a cart.

Quick start:

1. From `frontend/` run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open http://localhost:5173 and ensure the backend is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000

Notes:
- Uses Bootstrap for styling and `axios` for HTTP requests.
- API base can be changed via `VITE_API_BASE` env variable.
